## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses three CSV files:  
1. `Marketing_Campaign_Details.csv` – campaign information (type, duration, channel, etc.)  
2. `Marketing_Campaign_Performance.csv` – performance metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, spend)  
3. `Region_Performance.csv` – region-wise attributes

## 🛠 Data Preparation  
- Imported all CSV files into Power BI.  
- Cleaned data: renamed columns, corrected data types, handled nulls & duplicates.  
- Standardized column names (`CampaignName`, `CampaignType`, `Spend`, `Revenue`, etc.).
